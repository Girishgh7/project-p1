Everything is restricted in this app you can't even play your favourite song or particular part and can't search any song, for using basic feature they ask for premium.Will recommend other any apps (yes you can download even 1 star rating music apps, as Spotify is now not even deserve 1 star. People should stop using this useless only ads playing and money looting app. shame on you Spotify",1

First, there doesn't seem to be a useful rating system. This also means that their recommendation engine is clueless. You can't import RSS feeds. You can't tell it that you just don't want to see a podcast ever again. It's difficult to search through history. You can't just 'buy' an audiobook. Going forward or back podcast episodes is inconsistent and frustrating.",4

ee9b0614-89fa-48c4-83a0-4597e6fd6b3b,The new update sucks. We were able to search for an artist's all songs. But that's no longer an option. This is an Example of how we are slowly conforming to a new era.,2

After every song? Adds once in a while is fine but every song? I feel something spotify fails to realise is that after a new music app comes out with skips and not as many adds etc, spotify will lose a large chunk off their $15.020B they make yearly. Please let me look at lyrics and skip songs!! It's driving me mad!",3

My case was that if you have already added it from an album, but try to add the same song from an artist's top 5, it wouldnt recognize that it has already been added The thing is that sometimes you forget a song, somehow stumbled upon it again, love the song to bits, wonder if you have added it or not, and make yourself stupid for not adding it, for it to be already added like 2 months ago",1

Now, when I play Spotify music on my phone (Galaxy S21 Ultra), it cuts out of the currently playing song (usually with at least a minute or more) and jumps to the next song in the queue. Even upgraded my Roku device but it didn't help. So much for Spotify. YouTube music works great though, so if this issue isn't fixed that's where I'm headed.

More importantly, when I click on a song, it plays another random song, nothing even similar to the artist or the genre. It says it's playing a suggested song, but that's not what I want. What's wrong with playing the song I want to listen to? It's all pointless to me. I made a playlist a while back and I have the same issue here.",1

01389dc3-665f-47dc-974d-bd068eded65a,The new updates just ruined it. I got annoyed when they removed the ability skip songs but they just went ahead and made it impossible to move the time slider of the song. So basically you have the hear the entire thing if you wanted to hear one specific part again. And buying premium is not worth it because it just gives you the features that were free in the first place and also the audio clarity of premium is not really helpful as all it does is just making some songs louder. No one like this,1

We're adults here I'm not watching it myself and my passengers are watching it and you guys took the video away. Unless there's some way around it I'm just going to go back to YouTube,5

Non-premium users have limited viewing of lyrics each month, limited skips, and limited choosing of songs. Before all of that, Non-premium users only had ads. Spotify is slowly turning into a subscription music app which I didn't sign up for when I first downloaded this app. I switched from yt music to spotify for the best experience only for it to turn out like this. Fix this, Spotify.",1

If Spotify changes and fixes all these then I am absolutely ready to give it a 5 out of 5. Hope Spotify will listen to it's loyal users.,1

The time will advance on each track but no sound will come out of either the phone or the Bluetooth connected to it.

9483e60f-0cdc-413e-b507-b0d4ccd87247,"I have been using spotify for a few years now and while I have no problem with the service itself, the app is absolute dogshit. 90% of the time it can't do the most simple task of connecting to the internet, it's extremely slow, it crashes if you skip too fast, it cuts audio out of nowhere and so many other small problems. I'm thoroughly convinced that everyone that works for spotify are a bunch of braindead, useless wastes of space. fix your app.",2

Another big one, with their new feature of playing randomized like music (both songs from your playlist and new/similar ones), the button for changing this seema bugged out. You can randomly play your playlist, use the above feature, but turning it off, causes the song to loop, instead of simply playing down the list in order.. frustrating",3

9107d98d-acdd-4230-ad8e-44090bcca6fa,I originally gave Spotify 5 stars in 2016 - so sad to be here 8 years later to change it to one star. The app has taken a turn for the worst and I'm not hopeful it will ever be what it was. Spotify is responsible for exposing me to some of my favorite artists and now I just get the same 5 songs no matter what I play. I'm so disappointed.,1

Maybe one day they will understand what they have done by doing that. Or wait for someone else who will make a better app where we can hear to music for free! That's the only thing we do..,1
0e47cbb6-b9a4-4a04-9291-a5ea51774f63,Spotify would be so much better if it didn't add the same 15 songs to every song radio. I'm trying to listen to different similar music not the same songs I already know. Also a way to easily add liked songs from an artist into a playlist would be great.,3

cb69d146-01c4-4a2c-a8cf-e947242305d7,Spotify has progressively gotten worse at playing music I want and does not understand my listening habits. I have young kids that dominate my playlists but Spotify doesn't recognize when I am listening vs. my kids. All it does is play the same songs and has done an injustice to the millions of songs and artists that are to be discovered. It's shuffle and random algorithms they still get wrong. It's a pop music pusher and at this point thinking about switching to another service.,2

Music wise though, I find the app lacking in comparison to the desktop version. I understand that choosing which songs to play in a specific playlist and in what order is a paid feature, but it feels redundant when I could go to the desktop version to do that. The limited lyric update also feels useless and it feels more like a nuisance. Otherwise, it's a decent app, but I can't justify two more stars",3

0086db68-6abc-4ba9-9255-4979dbbc476b,Worst app ever!! Like not being able to listen previous song wasn't and listening to 2 minutes add after every song enough now we can't even listen to the song we want to and can't skip a song. Downloading Spotify was my biggest mistake because you can't even listen to the song you want to without taking premium subscription . Spotify has crossed all limits and now forcing it's users to buy premium subscription. I'm uninstalling this app because other apps like resso and jio savan are way better,1

You can't remove podcaast from their prepoluated list of new episodes it doesn't auto play the new episodes of podcasts you follow and will throw in random ones instead that may be in your wheelhouse but then you have to search for the podcast you want to listen to manually so when driving that's not safe to do I am not very impressed by it for podcast listening.,2

cd184d27-9699-4df9-848d-d555e7edb105,People in the comments are crying about how all the features are made premium. But they need to understand that spotify is not an ngo. They have to make a profit too for running the company. And spotify is cheap in countries like India. Large portion of the spotify profit is taken by big music labels. And the company have peanuts to keep the company running with such tough competition. They aren't able to provide lyrics as it cost money so better stop complaining and pay for the services.,5

It's an alright app if you have premium but probably not worth it without. The recommendations used to be a little fresher but now I see the same albums coming up constantly.

I remember there used to be a feature to save your queue as a playlist but that seems to be gone now. I would literally listen to so much more music if I could make playlists easier.,3

Sometimes more. Rewinding is a pay wall feature, and all of the ads sound 2 levels of audio higher than anything they let you listen to. The app is like Pandora. It's only good to find new artists.

They dont really care for the people who just want to access decent quality music and it shows as you can't even click on a song anymore without another one playing instead. Not only this but the app is poorly designed in general and is too tedious to get by unless you use a laptop. Your better of using youtube because at least they dont give you 5 ads in a row promoting premium,1

And I hate that every time I want to add a song to a playlist, I end up liking it instead. And when I need to like a song that has already been added to a playlist, I can't like it by pressing the + button, so I have to SEARCH for 'Liked Songs' to finally like the song.

All smart shuffle does is get in the way and play popular yet mediocre songs that don't even fit in my carefully curated playlists. Plus, when I don't like what the og song shuffle gave me, I usually just double tap the shuffle bouton to get a new list, but now I have to wait for the glitchy programing of smart shuffle to set in only to remove it and it will glitch out the music I'm listening to!

They are just forcing you to buy their premium. In ads they say listen to song uninterrupted for 30 min but again then after 5 min they come with an ad.

I can't play songs in order now and every single features are gone And this 1.9 rating tells everything you guy's deserved it.,1

158c05a7-9212-4146-9814-ad566db41bd8,I've had Spotify for longer than I can remember at this point but I plan to get rid of it soon. It's constantly getting worse. It lags really badly. I can turn the app off completely and the music keeps playing. It has a smart shuffle feature that nobody likes but is still forced on everyone. And all of that is when you DO have premium. I can't imagine how horrible the free version must be at this point. I'm searching for a better servic & gonna switch as soon as I'm able.,1

That 30 minutes lasts around 15 minutes. However, premium is fantastic. Ad-free, limitless downloads, and unlimited song selection, among other features. I also enjoy the Spotify DJ, it's wonderful! 1 feature I'd like is for automatic playlist sorting based on the songs in that playlist that you listen to the most, if that makes any sense!",5

Edit: Spotify has removed some of the restrictions so the app is not that bad anymore well I will use Spotify again. These changes earned a 4 star.,4

7ff50a5b-6999-47fc-af69-d0ce0885fc13,Before I was thinking that Boomplay was better than Spotify. My classmates convinced me that Spotify is the best. Didn't still believe but later I downloaded the app and I didn't regret Spotify actually creates mixed up playlists with your favorite artists.,5
ace4c32a-fbca-49c6-ae43-d0b0cbf62f88,Very good i can listen to music it does its job i suggest you pay to make the ads go away tho cuz those suck,4
35c96fc2-9c06-41b4-b0a1-3d0a4081bd65,"Im just tired of seeing how this app is barrying free users from basic features. Im now on my premium subscription,but for above a year I had spotify free because i wanted to listen to music. Like I don't get why you have a limit on lyrics,where you can just type it on the internet?The ads we're bearable,but 6 skips per hour,only smart shuffle,can't skip to any different part of a song and other things are just so absurd.The new font is horrible. And from what im seeing its just getting worse.",2
